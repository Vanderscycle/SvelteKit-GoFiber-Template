# Frontend

Note: Ensure that you have the right adapter otherwise you will get this [ error ](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/1257)

with the dockek container we must use the correct [adapte](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters)

## Auth
I do believe web3 will become more and more present as blockchain technology matures and so I am using [ magic ](https://magic.link/) for user auth. You will need to create an account.

## todo
- [ ] add a ternary operator for the adapter (vercel vs node)

## env
```
VITE_WEBSITE_STATE=
GO_BACKEND_URL=
GO_BACKEND_PORT=
```
